                    <p>Bring your laptop, charger, headphones, and anything else you need. We'll supply hardware, meals, and snacks. More to come soon!</p>

                    <h3>Who is eligible?</h3>

Teams can be up to four members - you can register with your team when you apply, or any time after you’re accepted, but you can also create a team at the event!</p>

                    <h3>Are there any costs?</h3>
                    <p>The event is free, thanks to our sponsors! We will offer travel reimbursement -- just indicate where you’re coming from when you apply, and we’ll reach out to you.</p>

                    <h3>Can I use past projects?</h3>
                    <p>True to the spirit of hackathons, you may not submit your past projects to HackGT.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need any experience to apply?</h3>
                    <p>Experience isn’t required. Hackathons are a place to learn for anybody at any level. Some of our past winners are also first-timers at a hackathon. But, if you’re still not convinced, like our Facebook page for updates about workshops or events we’ll host before HackGT that’ll teach you some introductory skills!</p>
