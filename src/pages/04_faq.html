                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                    <p>Bring your laptop, charger, headphones, and anything else you need. We'll supply hardware, meals, and snacks. More to come soon!</p>

                    <h3>Where is HackGT 5?</h3>
                    <p>The event will be taking place on Georgia Tech campus in the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Tqnadk8yaGA2">Klaus Advanced Computing Building.</a></p>                    

                    <h3>Who is eligible?</h3>
                    <p>Any student over the age of 18 enrolled in a college or university is allowed to participate, but anyone can be a mentor or volunteer. Teams can be up to four members - you can register with your team when you apply, or any time after you’re accepted, but you can also create a team at the event!</p>
                    <p>If you are younger than 18, but a Georgia Tech student, you can still participate.</p>

                    <h3>Are there any costs?</h3>
                    <p>The event is free, thanks to our sponsors! We will offer travel reimbursement -- just indicate where you’re coming from when you apply, and we’ll reach out to you.</p>

                    <h3>Can I use past projects?</h3>
                    <p>True to the spirit of hackathons, you may not submit your past projects to HackGT.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need any experience to apply?</h3>
                    <p>Experience isn’t required. Hackathons are a place to learn for anybody at any level. Some of our past winners are also first-timers at a hackathon. If you’re a GT student, make sure to like our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HackGT/">Facebook page</a> for updates on HackGTeeny, our workshop-filled day of hackathon prep exclusive for Georgia Tech students.</p>
                    
                    <h3>If I don’t want to participate, can I still get involved?</h3>
                    <p>Of course! If you are interested in mentoring or volunteering at the event, click apply and you will see the correct application path to take. Please be advised that travel reimbursement is not available for volunteers or mentors.</p>

                    <h3>What are Campsites?</h3>
                    <p>Think office hours - regroup, refocus, re-engage! Each path will have the opportunity to come together and receive specialized help from our mentors and sponsors throughout the event.</p>
