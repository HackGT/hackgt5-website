            <p>Dear Hacker, <br> <br>

Through large-scale collegiate hackathons and smaller, individualized workshops, our organization aims to spread the spirit of innovation and creativity within computer science education. We’ve created HackGT: Dare to Venture to be an experience like no other - down to the smallest of embers. We want every participant to have fun, engage with new ideas, and create lasting, positive memories. With friends at your side, resources at every corner, and support around every turn, HackGT will empower you to unleash your inner trailblazer. We are incredibly excited to see the jaw-dropping projects and innovations that you have in store! <br><br>
